    <p>These walkthroughs assume basic competence when building colonies. They primarily cover the things that make a specific scenario difficult - they don't hold your hand and walk you through every last detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where relevant, I have included simple ASCII representations of maps. Maps are always aligned with North towards the top of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Objectives are numbered in the order in which they appear. Normally the lowest numbered objectives need to be completed before others are shown. Where several objectives are given at the same time, they are shown with letters, for example 1a, 1b. If you
        do not know how to read the objectives as you play, see <a href="interface.html#gp_2_2" title="Gameplay: Can I see the current objectives in-game?">Can I see the current objectives in-game?</a> above.
    </p>
    <p>
        The in-game rating for each scenario is shown as 1-4 stars, where 1 star is easy, 4 hardest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since many do not enjoy the war aspects of the game, I have added a "war-o-meter" rating to each scenario, to give an indication of how important the war aspects are. The scale is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>* = Entirely city/economy building. No other hostile players to fight, even if you wanted to (I exclude natives from the list of possible hostile players here).
        </li>
        <li>** = Objectives can be completed without warfare, and you are unlikely to need to go to war.
        </li>
        <li>*** = Warfare is needed to complete the scenario, but city building/economy is what makes this scenario difficult.
        </li>
        <li>**** = War is a major objective, with city building/economy secondary.
        </li>
        <li>***** = War is the only objective.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Here is a summary of ratings and war-o-meters:</p>
