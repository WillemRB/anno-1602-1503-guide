    <p>Your old friend, Ramirez, from <a href="barbarrossas_throne.html" title="Campaign: Barbarrossas' Throne.">Barbarrossas' Throne</a> is back for one last battle. And that's about all there is to this scenario. At the start steal Cannon and Mortars
        that are lurking near the "Ghost Town" just to north of your start position. A Scout can be expended to reveal the location of the enemy fortifications (to the west of your start location). Beware of the Crocodiles. Try dragging the enemy
        army out, and fight them away from fixed defences such as towers. To complete the scenario get at least one unit to the pair of obelisks in the centre of the enemy settlement. There is no need to destroy all enemy units.</p>
