    <h3 id="scen_9_2">7.9.2 Strategy overview</h3>
    <p>This is a somewhat harder version of <a href="many_small_islands.html" title="Original Scenarios: Many Small Islands.">Many Small Islands</a> (see above). The map is characterised by a lack of large islands suitable for city building. In addition,
        mineral deposits are rarer, pirates are active, and the population objective is far higher.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is just possible to fit enough Pioneer housing (375 houses) on the map, but not recommended - see Zachary Ruuse's comments below. There is no Marble, so Merchant housing can not be reached. This leaves a choice between reaching the objective primarily
        with Settler housing (200 total) or Citizen housing (~110 total), or some combination of the two. On some islands, one can profitably build enough houses around the facilities Settlers need. This inevitably means shipping in Cloth and Alcohol
        from other production islands. Attempt to fit 360 Settlers into one city to allow Hop based Alcohol production. Cloth production will always be space inefficient using Sheep Farms. One of the main benefits to developing some Citizens is the
        ability to access buildings such as Cotton Plantations. The disadvantage to Citizens is the level of support infrastructure they require - both large items such as Churches on their island, plus some level of Spice/Tobacco/Salt provision.
        Consider using Fishermen to provide Food - expensive to operate, but require little land to build.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pirates should be far more annoying than they are. The scenario forces you to ship almost everything between islands, but pirates are rarely effective in disrupting this trade. Ultimately, the main benefit of destroying their colony is not to prevent
        piracy, but to claim the land it occupies (it is one of the larger islands available).
    </p>
    <p>
        Zachary Ruuse, on using only Pioneer housing: "Tools were the obvious problem in going for all out pioneers (pirates wouldn't trade them until I had about 2 tools left)." Decisions such as whether to provide one stall or two, become critical. "For wood,
        I designated 'island b' for wood production. I built 6 forester huts on there bunched in groups of 2 ... they were all at 100%. For food ... I could only use fishing huts since they were the most space-efficient." The final act was to remove
        wood production, and colonise that island with housing.</p>
