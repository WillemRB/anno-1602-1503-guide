    <h3 id="walk_13_2">6.13.2 Objective: Find the treasure</h3>
    <p>This is a bonus scenario, which is unlocked by completing the campaign. Once you have completed <a href="justice.html" title="Campaign: Justice.">Justice</a>, return to the single player campaign screen and select the scenario. The aim is to find
        a hidden treasure chest. You do this by moving a Scout to wherever you think the treasure is... or just move your Scout across every island. The Scout only needs to go within around 6-8 squares to spot the treasure chest. You cannot find the
        treasure by scanning the map by eye, it is only revealed by the Scout.
    </p>
    <p>
        Run away from the pirates. Maybe a skilled player could use the small starting force and ship to destroy all their colonies before running out of cash or troops, and still find the treasure, but this is not required. Just keep your ship moving at all
        times.

        Budgie writes: "If you don't want to explore all islands, have a look on the amulet map." The map inside the amulet can only be seen briefly during the introductory video. Make a mental note of the shape of the island - it is *very* distinctive. Don't
        worry about where the marker lines point - once you have the correct island, it will be easy to find the treasure. And that is the only hint I'll give... it is not hard to find the island with this hint. It is the last scenario anyway, so
        no harm done if you _still_ cannot find the treasure %-) .</p>

    <h3 id="walk_13_3">6.13.3 To be continued...</h3>
    <p>"It seemed as if the secret of the amulet had been revealed, but as you find evidence of the presence of von Breitenstein and his fellow men, doubts arise. Although the heart of von Breitenstein's power has been destroyed, the chapter has not
        yet ended. To be continued..."</p>
