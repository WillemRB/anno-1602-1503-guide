<h3 id="tmp_7_2">8.7.2 Strategy overview</h3><p>Gather your forces together by moving your initial fleet towards to Eskimo island ("a" on the map above), which will reveal a second fleet. Now head south towards the G-shaped island ("c" on the map above). The waterway into the centre of the island is guarded by Defensive Towers and ground troops belonging to Douglas Millham. The central bay contain six hostile vessels belonging to Fernando Moar. Attack the first enemy Defensive Tower from the land, which allows you to engage it from behind. The remaining Defensive Towers can be removed by destroying the Main Market. Finally attack the ships moored in the large bay in the centre of the island. Try baiting one or two at a time, otherwise your ships risk being sunk. Do not attack Fernando Moar's settlement on the far southern side of the island. Why? Read on.
</p><p>
Now head for the island marked "d" on the map above. Don't worry if your fleet is heavily damaged - there are no more major naval threats. Fernando Moar's units are on the elevated eastern part of the island, which will probably force a land battle. Watch out for the hostile wolves on the western approach. As you near the settlement the enemy soldiers will attack. Don't engage buildings. The fight is a blood-bath, but you should win.
</p><p>
Once all the enemy soldiers have been killed Fernando Moar surrenders his colonies to you. Unless you intend to attack Douglas Millham rapidly, you will need to make some adjustments to stop losing money. Various minor tweaks are required, such as road connections and planting of fields. Switch Alcohol production fully to Hops, with a purge Small Farms. On a similar note, Food production can be rationalised - in particular partial Grain chains. Eliminate some useless industry - for example, a rogue Weaving Mill on the Tobacco colony ("g" on the map above) and the second Salt Mine on the G-shaped island. The armament island either duplicates production found on your main colony or consists of incomplete production chains. For example, Armor can be produced in your main colony, and there are stocks of Iron and Leather there to do it. It will require a lot of effort to move goods elsewhere (either by extending territory to the point where you cane build a coastal Warehouse, or by use of Scouts), so it may be best to abandon the armament island completely. Lastly consider tweaking your main town - notably the position of the School and Doctor.
</p><p>
Douglas Millham has no offensive navy. No shipyard. However, the enemy is dependant on other islands for production of Spices, Tobacco and Salt. You can use your remaining units and ships to either destroy or capture these colonies, and sink or capture his trading ships. When you see Millham build a shipyard, destroy it. This strategy helps weaken Millham (just watch all his pretty Citizen houses crumble to dust), and prevents him attacking you: There is no need for walls and towers around your town if the enemy can't even launch.
</p><p>
As soon as you land troops on his main island ("j" on the map above) Millham will send a large number of units out against you. This pattern will continue as you advance towards the Castle. Removing Iron production will eventually result in Millham only sending Pikemen, which are far easier to deal with. Bring plenty of Medics, spare crew, and good hand-to-hand fighters. Destroy the Castle to complete the fifth objective and gain control of the colony. You don't need this colony, so stop yourself losing cash by deleting its remaining Main Markets.
</p><p>
To complete the scenario, find and destroy the remaining Millham units - they are hiding in the Bedouin settlement on the island marked "m" on the map above.</p>
