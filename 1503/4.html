<div id="contents" class="content">

    <p>This section contains short answers to specific commonly asked questions. Associated <a href="5.html" title="Strategies: Planning, management, trade, military.">Strategies</a> are contained in a later section. This section assumes one has at least
        skimmed through the manual, attempted to play the game and/or completed the tutorials: It does not cover absolutely everything, just topics which have confused new players enough for them to ask the question.</p>

    <p>Topic specific information may be found in-game, by clicking the question mark icon on the bottom bar or pressing F1, and typing in the name of the thing you want information on. However, much of the content of the in-game help seems to have been
        written without regard to features that changed mid-development or were never implemented, so you will find many inaccuracies. Also, the extended tutorial level, the Citizen difficulty endless game, includes a series of hints in the form of
        message icons that appear at the bottom of the screen.</p>
