    <h3 id="gp_7_1">4.7.1 How do you research?</h3>
    <p>From FaithRaven: "For research you need a School and later a University. To research, you need research points (given by population and it's level) and gold [coins]." Research points slowly build up over time at your School or University, up to
        a maximum level (see below). Click on the School or University to view the research options. Only one type of research can be conducted at once, as ratha notes: "When you click to do research on something, and then you click to do research
        on something else, you lose all your research points for the first research."</p>

    <h3 id="gp_7_2">4.7.2 How do I research above a certain level of knowledge points?</h3>
    <p>Research is limited by the population number and civilisation level, and the type of facility available. The number of facilities you have does not make a difference. Libraries add 10 research points to the total, but must be first researched
        at a University, and then built. To save upkeep cost, S.SubZero comments: "I built the library, got the last technology, and then deleted the library, with no ill effect." This applies to all research - once something is known, it cannot be
        lost during that game. Dobber notes: "Make sure you have done all your research before going 'all-Aristocrat', since they do not go to school." The following table is based on various sources, including Andj Pianto, BaldJim and Wargamerit:</p>

    <h3 id="gp_7_3">4.7.3 Why can't I build cannon after researching them?</h3>
    <p>There are two types of Cannon, ship and land. The initial cannon research (probably at a School) only allows ship cannon. Further research at a University is required for ground based Cannon. See <a href="military_units.html#gp_11_10" title="Gameplay: What is the difference between ship and land cannon?">What is the difference between ship and land cannon?</a>            below.</p>
