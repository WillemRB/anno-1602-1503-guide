    <p>The first table, prepared by Charlie ( <a href="http://www.anno-zone.de/Charlie/index.html" title="External link: Charlie.">http://www.anno-zone.de/Charlie/index.html</a> ), shows the productivity of industries. 'Combine' values are for 2 farms
        and 1 processing building, except for the Grain Combine, which is 4 farms, 2 Windmills, and a Bakery. The table is included here for the benefit of non-German speakers (like me). Min (minute) values are for one cycle - one cycle is about one
        minute on most machines.</p>

    <p>** = Alternative values may apply, depending on whether Sheep farms or Cotton plantations are used.</p>

    <p>Lord Khang cites the following yields from food production:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hunting Lodge - 1 Killed Deer = 1 ton of Food.
        </li>
        <li>Fishing Hut - 3 squares fished = 1 ton of Food.
        </li>
        <li>Cattle Farm - 3 squares grazed = 1 ton of Beef.
        </li>
        <li>Butcher's Shop - 2 tons of Beef = 1 ton of Food.
        </li>
        <li>Grain Farm - 1 square reaped = 1 ton of Grain.
        </li>
        <li>Flour Mill - 2 tons of Grain = 1 ton of Flour.
        </li>
        <li>Bakery - 2 tons of Flour = 1 ton of Food.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Sheep Farm - 4 squares grazed = 1 ton of wool.
        </li>
        <li>Weaving Hut - 2 tons of wool = 1 ton of cloth.
        </li>
        <li>Cotton Plantation - 1 square picked = 1 ton of wool.
        </li>
        <li>Weaving Mill - 2 tons of wool = 1 ton of cloth.
        </li>
        <li>Tailor's Shop - 1 ton of cloth = 1 ton of clothes.
        </li>
        <li>Tobacco Plantation - 2 squares picked = 1 ton of tobacco.
        </li>
        <li>Tobacco Products - 2 tons of tobacco = 1 ton of cigars.
        </li>
        <li>Winery - 4 squares picked = 1 ton of Alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>Sugar Plantation - 2 squares picked = 1 ton of Cane.

    <p>Lord Khang conducted a further test: "Test was run for 10 minutes at Quadruple speed after the packages had a chance to gear up. In each package a single marketplace was dedicated for final product haulage. In all cases this marketplace was placed
        directly next to the end producer for zero travel time:</p>
    <ul class="spacedlist">
        <li>Fishing Package - 1 Fisher's Hut. No gear up for this guy, just dropped the hut and started the timer. Total space utilized: 1 Coastline hex + 9 squares fishing ground. Total yield after time elapsed: 27 tons of food.
        </li>
        <li>Cattle Package - 1 Butcher's Shop, 2 Cattle Farms. Utilized optimal 24 squares cattle farms as described above. Total space utilized was 52 squares for the package. (40 yield square, 12 building squares) No road necessary. Gear up time was
            allowing each of the cattle farms 2 cows to get 1 full cycle of grazing producing a total of 2 tons of beef at each farm when the timer was then started. Total yield after time elapsed: 88 tons of food.
        </li>
        <li>Grain Package - 1 Bakery, 2 Flour Mill, 4 Grain Farm. Utilized a new grain combine layout I have been working on that fits in 72 squares broken down as follows: 42 square yield land (2 farms at 10 square, 2 farms at 11 square), 28 squares
            for the 7 buildings, 2 squares road. Gear up time was allowing for the full maturation of the grain fields, followed by allowing each of the grain farms to harvest 2 square of grain (producing 2 tons of grain) when the timer was started.
            Total yield after time elapsed: 108 tons of food.
        </li>
        <li>Hunting Package - 1 Hunting Lodge. No gear up for this guy, just drop the lodge and start the timer. Space required 1 square + a crap load of yield squares. Total yield after time elapsed: 46 TONS OF FOOD.
        </li>
        <li>Cloth Package A: 1 Weaver's Hut, 2 Sheep Farms. Farm spits out 3 sheep, each of which graze for 4 squares before returning to be sheared. Note that the grazing area has to reactivate, so the sheep will not graze from a given square for a while.
            Efficiency: 85-100%. Total yield after time elapsed: 73 tons cloth.
        </li>
        <li>Cloth Package B: 1 Weaving Mill, 2 Cotton Plantations. The field hands don't even touch 10 yield squares, and 3 additional yield squares are touched only once every 3rd 16 square picking cycle. We can shave this sucker down to a 6 x 4, and
            still get max efficiency from it. Total yield after time elapsed: 116 tons of cloth.
        </li>
        <li>Clothing Package: 1 Tailor's Shop. Total yield after time elapsed: 76 tons of clothes.
        </li>
        <li>Cigar Package: 1 Tobacco Products, 2 Tobacco Plantations. 5 untouched squares of yield land [out of 28]. Shave this sucker down to 24 square as well for 28% greater yield. Total yield after time elapsed: 70 tons of cigars.
        </li>
        <li>Alcohol Package A: 1 Winery. All 26 yield squares required to maintain fluid production cycles. Grapes grow slow I guess. Total yield after time elapsed: 42 tons of Alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>Alcohol Package B: 1 Distillery, 2 Sugarcane Plantations. Land usage as for Tobacco. Total yield after time elapsed: 70 tons of Alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>Cocoa Package: 1 Cocoa Plantation. 5 untouched squares of yield land [out of 28]. I can actually chop off 8 squares to make a 24 sq total farm (6 x 4) and still obtain greater than 75% efficiency with the available 18 yield squares remaining
            (after farm and road). Total yield after time elapsed: 44 tons of Cocoa.
        </li>
        <li>Spice Package: 1 Spice Plantation. Land usage as for Cocoa. Total yield after time elapsed: 44 tons of Spice."

        Lord Khang also compares different methods of alcohol production directly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Alcohol Package A - 5 Winery. Build Cost: 1500 gold, 10 tools, 15 wood, 40 bricks; maintenance cost is 175 gold/cycle. Space taken - 160 squares. Total Yield after time elapsed: 210 tons alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>Alcohol Package B - 3 Distillery, 6 Sugar Plantations. Build Cost: 2400 gold, 21 tools, 24 wood, 63 bricks; maintenance cost is 195 gold/cycle. Space taken - 156 squares. (Remember, using optimal 24 square plantations.) Total Yield after time
            elapsed: 211 tons alcohol."
