# ANNO 1602 & ANNO 1503 Guide
A backup somebody made from a website containing an ANNO 1602 and an ANNO 1503 guide.
The original guides have been taken from http://capsu.org/. The site is no longer avaiable.

I'm cleaning up the pages and going to host it on a static page host.
- Cleaning takes out anything that was added by HTTrack or is otherwise not needed.
- I also remove the Google Analytics code.
- The searchbox is also removed. Might replace it with something else.
